# M83: Test Suite Repair — Fix 119 Failing Tests

## Goal
Repair the failing test suite to reach >=98% coverage threshold required by DBB compliance.

## Current State (2026-04-07T05:34)
- 3 tasks done, 2 todo (blocked by task-1775538907092), 1 blocked
- task-1775538907092 reassigned to tech_lead-1 (P0, unblocked — pick up immediately)

## Tasks

|------|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| task-1775538907092 | Fix TTS import paths to use package.json imports map | P0 | tech_lead-1 | todo |
| task-1775535887205 | Fix TTS runtime test setup — add missing init() call | P0 | tester-1 | todo (blocked by task-1775538907092) |
