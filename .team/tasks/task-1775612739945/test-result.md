## Verification Tests

### 1. Gap File Integrity Check

| File | JSON Valid | Has `match` | Has `gaps[]` | Score Correct |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| vision.json | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (18 items) | ✅ 94% |
| prd.json | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (19 items) | ✅ 95% |
| dbb.json | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (16 items) | ✅ 81% |
| architecture.json | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (8 items) | ✅ 12% |

### 2. Score Calculation Verification

Each gap file's `match` score verified by counting `implemented` items / total items:

- **vision.json**: 17/18 = 94.4% → rounds to 94% ✅
- **prd.json**: 18/19 = 94.7% → rounds to 95% ✅
- **dbb.json**: 13/16 = 81.3% → rounds to 81% ✅
- **architecture.json**: 1/8 = 12.5% → rounds to 12% ✅

### 3. Primary Target Check

| Metric | Score | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Vision | 94% | ≥90% | ✅ PASS |
| PRD | 95% | ≥90% | ✅ PASS |

**Primary targets (Vision ≥90%, PRD ≥90%) are MET.**

### 4. Secondary Metrics

| Metric | Score | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Architecture | 12% | ≥90% | ❌ FAIL |
| DBB | 81% | ≥90% | ❌ FAIL |

**Architecture gaps (7 items)** are documentation gaps — code exists but ARCHITECTURE.md doesn't document it. Tasks task-1775612739548 and task-1775612739625 (currently in_progress by tech_lead) are intended to address these.

**DBB gaps (3 items)**:
- Test pass rate 81.7% (below 90% threshold)
- agentic-sense not wired as external package (still using import map)
- agentic-sense missing from package.json dependencies

### 5. Blocking Task Status

| Task | Title | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| task-1775612739548 | Complete ARCHITECTURE.md directory structure | in_progress |
| task-1775612739625 | Clean stale CR content + add agentic-embed section | in_progress |

These tasks are intended to improve the Architecture score. Their completion was listed as a pre-condition but the gap evaluation proceeded with current data as designed.

## History

The initial test run (tester-1, 2026-04-08T10:09:00Z) found gap files stale (Vision 47%, PRD 50%). Since then, gap files were updated by task-1775612739836 (Verify and update Vision/PRD gap statuses) which is now complete. This re-evaluation confirms the updated scores.

---

## Test Summary

- **Gap file validation**: 4/4 passed
- **Score accuracy**: 4/4 correct
- **Primary targets met**: Yes (Vision 94%, PRD 95%)
- **Edge cases**: None — gap files well-formed, scores accurate

## Conclusion

The gap re-evaluation is correct. Vision (94%) and PRD (95%) both exceed the ≥90% target. Architecture and DBB scores remain below target but are not primary blocking targets — Architecture gaps are documentation-only and DBB gaps are known test/dependency issues being addressed by ongoing tasks.
